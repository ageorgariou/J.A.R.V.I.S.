## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run Jarvis on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/jarvis.git

   ```
   cd jarvis
   ```
3. **Install Required Packages**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Setting Up Email Functionality

To enable Jarvis to send emails, you need to set up an app password for your email account.

1. **Create an App Password for Gmail**
   - Follow this video guide to create an app password: [How to Create Gmail App Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqPmaDxigNY)
2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - Alternatively, you can modify the script to read from a secure configuration file.

### Setting Up Google Calendar Access

Jarvis can read your Google Calendar events if you provide it with the necessary credentials.

1. **Obtain Google Calendar API Credentials**
   - Watch this video guide to obtain `credentials.json` for Google Calendar API: [Setting Up Google Calendar API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njjGOz3L4WU)
2. **Place `credentials.json` in the Project Root**
   - Ensure the `credentials.json` file is located in the same directory as the script.

### Running Jarvis

After completing the setup, you can run Jarvis using the following command:

```
python main.py
```
